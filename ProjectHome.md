This is the community site for [The Savory Framework](http://threecrickets.com/savory/), a collection of ready-to-use code to help you tackle much of the dreary work required for building massively multi-user web applications. It relies on and fully embraces [Prudence](http://threecrickets.com/prudence/) (the "Savory JavaScript" flavor) and MongoDB, two platforms designed from the ground-up for REST-friendly scalability. With Savory you can quickly get users logging in, accessing data with permissions, subscribing to email notifications, shopping and paying you, interacting with each other, and managing their own content on your site. It lets you cleanly integrate with third party technologies and services, from Ext JS and Sencha Touch to Facebook.
