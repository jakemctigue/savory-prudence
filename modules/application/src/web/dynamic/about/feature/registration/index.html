<h1>Savory's Registration Feature</h1>
<p>
	This complement to the <a href="../../service/authentication/">authentication service</a> uses a two-step
	process to allow new users to register to your application. As is common, it expects users to
	have a personal email address, which will be used to both confirm the identity of the user
	and to communicate with the user when they are not logged in.
</p>
<p>
	The feature contains a /web/fragment/ HTML form with a CAPTCHA, which collects the user's
	email, username, password and possibly some personal information. The form will be valid
	only of the username is not already in use.
</p>
<p>
	If the form is valid, the user is created but not yet activated. An email is sent to the
	user with a unique, impossible-to-guess URL, which can be used only once. If they click on that
	link, the user is activated. 
</p>
<p>
	The feature allows for not-yet-activated users to be automatically deleted after a certain
	time. This would release the username for others to use.
</p>
<p>
	Refer to the <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/api/?namespace=Savory.Registration">Savory.Registration API documentation</a>
	for more details.
