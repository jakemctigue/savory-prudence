<h1>Savory's "Contact Us" Feature</h1>
<p>
	This simple feature contains a /web/fragment/ that displays
	an HTML form with a CAPTCHA that allows users to send a message on a specific
	<a href="../../service/notification/">notification service</a> channel. System administrators
	or others subscribing to the channel would then receive it. Straightforward!
</p>
<p>
	Note that a different form is displayed depending on whether the user is logged in. Logged-in
	users will not have to enter their email address or pass the CAPTCHA. We already know they
	are legit, by virtue of having logged in!
</p>
<p>
	The originating IP address is included in the email. 
</p>
<p>
	Refer to the <a href="<%= conversation.pathToBase %>/api/?namespace=Savory.ContactUs">Savory.ContactUs API documentation</a>
	for more details.
