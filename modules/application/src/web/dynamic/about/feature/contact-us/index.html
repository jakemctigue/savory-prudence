<h1>Savory's "Contact Us" Feature</h1>
<p>
	This simple feature contains a /web/fragment/ that displays
	an HTML form with a CAPTCHA that allows users to send a message on a specific
	<a href="../../service/notification/">notification service</a> channel. System administrators
	or others subscribing to the channel would then receive it. Straightforward!
