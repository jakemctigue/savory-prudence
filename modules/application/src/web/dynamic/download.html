<h2>Early Bird Alert</h2>
<p class="note">
	What you will be downloading right now is an "Early Bird" release. "Early," in that it's not yet at "1.0" quality: what's missing is some
	more documentation and fleshing out a few last-in features. "Bird," in that it's the contemporary evolutionary descendent of dinosaurs, and
	dinosaurs are very cool. The bulk of the code is here and fully functional, and of immediate use. There's nothing stopping you from creating
	super-scalable, data-driven web and mobile applications with Savory right now.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
	You need <a href="http://threecrickets.com/prudence/download/">Prudence</a> and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>.
	That's it. If you're using them for the first time, it might be a good idea to get some familiarity with them first.
	Prudence comes with a big, printable Creative-Commons-licensed manual. And there are some decent books about MongoDB out there.
</p>

<h2>How to Install the Savory Framework</h2>
<p>
	Pick a distribution, download it and unzip it.
</p>
<p>
	Copy everything in the /libraries/ directory to your Prudence's /libraries/ directory. (Or, otherwise just make sure that they are
	in your JVM's classpath.)
</p>
<p>
	Then put "savory-common.prudence.zip" and a "savory-dependencies-common.prudence.zip" (or its debug version if you're
	using the debug edition) into your Prudence's /common/ subdirectory. Restart Prudence, and it will unpack these automagically.
</p>


<h2>How to Install the Demo Application</h2>
<p>
	The distribution comes with some demo data for MongoDB, all in the /demo-data/ directory. You need to put in the "savory"
	collection on MongoDB. An example command:
</p>
<pre>
	mongorestore --drop --db savory ./demo-data 
</pre>
<p>
	Then put 'savory-demo-application.prudence.zip' into your Prudence's /applications/ subdirectory.
	Restart Prudence, and it will unpack it automagically. You can then go to <a href="http://localhost:8080/savory/">http://localhost:8080/savory/</a>
	to see it. Have fun!
</p>
<p>
	All the demo users have the password "savory". There is a user named "savory", too. 
</p>
<p class="note">
	Note: Many of Savory's integration features (Facebook, Twitter, PayPal, etc.) require you to create accounts on those services, which
	then issue private security keys. You can edit the "/applications/savory/settings.js" with these keys, or otherwise
	create a "/applications/savory/settings-extra.js" to override the default blank settings for these. Beyond that, these services
	will likely need to callback to your application over the internet, so you may need to deploy the Savory demo application
	on a publicly available site to appreciate it fully.
</p>

<h2>OK, Let's Download!</h2>

<h3>Development Snapshot</h3>
<p>
	While in Early Bird status, you'll see multiple daily commits. Seriously, as soon as you download you'll already be out of date.
	For people wanting to keep in touch with the path to Savory 1.0, we recommend using the development snapshot and updating frequently. 
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/savory-prudence/source/checkout">Get it via Subversion</a>.
	Easy, quick build with <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a>.
</p>
<p>
	If that sounds like too much for you, go ahead and download one of these:
</p>

<h3>Standard Edition</h3>	
<p>
	You probably want this! It includes everything you need to get Savory up and running.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://savory-prudence.googlecode.com/files/savory-standard-R<%= revision %>.zip">The Savory Framework: Standard Edition</a> (9mb)
</p>

<h3>Debug Edition</h3>	
<p>
	This is identical to the standard edition, but also includes the debug versions of Ext JS and Sencha Touch.  
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://savory-prudence.googlecode.com/files/savory-debug-R<%= revision %>.zip">The Savory Framework: Debug Edition</a> (11mb)
</p>

<h3>Minimal Edition</h3>	
<p>
	This is Savory only, without any of its dependency libraries. This is useful if you just want to upgrade
	and you already have all the dependencies.
