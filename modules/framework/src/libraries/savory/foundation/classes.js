/**
 * Object Oriented Programming for JavaScript, Savory style.
 * <p>
 * Though JavaScript does not in itself have most OOP constructs, it provides all the essentials for
 * building an OOP framework. And this is Savory's take on it: we've opted for an especially lightweight
 * approach to provide the bare minimum required for an OOP development experience that promotes
 * clarity, consistency and functionality. If you've come from heavily OOP languages, such as Java or
 * Python, we'd like to encourage you to avoid automatically turning everything into a "class," and 
 * instead and choose more horizontal ways of code organization and reuse, via closures, raw prototypes
 * and duck typing. Use OOP only when it adds coherence to your code.
 * <p>
 * That said, Savory supports all OOP principles:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Encapsulation: This is already available, because functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript.
 * A dict can contain both data properties and functions. Additionally, the "this" keyword is automatically
 * linked to a new dict via the "new" keyword. The result is that data and functions are encapsulated
 * into a single instance.</li>
 * <li>Inheritance: There are two obvious ways to implement this in JavaScript -- by simply copying functions
 * over from another dict (which we could have done with {@link Savory.Objects#merge}) or at once by
 * setting the constructor's prototype. The latter offers better performance and more coherence, which is
 * why we chose it.</li>
 * <li>Polymorphism: Loose polymorphism is provided naturally via JavaScript's duck typing, which is
 * heavily used outside of OOP proper. What we add here is basic type information: the "instanceof"
 * keyword can be used to identify which constructor was used for an instance, and additionally returns
 * true if the instance is of a sub-class (by following the path of prototypes).</li>
 * </ol>
 * A fourth mini-principle is also sometimes mentioned in discussions of OOP: information hiding.
 * JavaScript's closures allow for a simple way to maintain scope in the instance without exposing it.
 * <p>
 * Another useful feature we support, which has become popular in many OOP implementations, is the ability
 * to annotate classes. Any key in the class definition that begins with "_" is not copied to prototype,
 * but can be accessed via the prototype's "definition" key. 
 * <p>
 * An example, with the module pattern:
 * <p>
 * (Note that this pattern does not let you create private properties that are <i>not</i> static.
 * Some would argue that this is no great loss, because too much information hiding can be
 * a bad practice. )
 * <pre>
 * // We are not providing a literal dict, but instead creating an "ad hoc" anonymous function,
 * // which we then immediately call, so that it only ever used this once for purposes of closure
 * var Person = Savory.Classes.define(function() {
 *   // We will be returning this dict to the outside world
 *   var Public = {}
 *   
 *   // This following var is private, because we're not putting it in "Public";
 *   // Note that it is also static, in that it will be shared between all instances
 *   // of the class!
 *   var privateName = 'Tal'
 *   
 *   // Constructor annotation
 *   Public._construct = function(pet) {
 *     // This will be a public property
 *     this.pet = pet
 *   }
 *   
 *   // Inheritance annotation
 *   Public._inherit = 'MyParentClass'
 *   
 *   // A custom annotation, which may be used by other systems in our application
 *   Public._saveToDatabase = 'people'
 *   
 *   // A public method
 *   Public.getName = function() {
 *     return privateName
 *   }
 *   
 *   // Another public method
 *   Public.getFriends = function(friend) {
 *     return makeFriends(privateName, friend)
 *   }
 *   
 *   // And another public method
 *   Public.getFriendsWithPet = function(friend) {
 *     // Note that unlike the previous method call, here we have to explicitly use "call"
 *     // in order to pass "this" to the method
 *     return makeFriendsWithPet.call(this, privateName, friend)
 *   }
 *   
 *   // A private method that only accesses private properties
 *   function makeFriends(friend1, friend2) {
 *     return friend1 + ' and ' + friend2
 *   }
 *   
 *   // Another private method; this one needs to access public properties
 *   function makeFriendsWithPet(friend1, friend2) {
 *     // Note the need to reference "this" here -- it must be provided when this method is called
 *     // (We could have also provided the the "this" reference as a simple argument to the method,
 *     // but using "this" keeps the code more coherent)
 *     return friend1 + ' and ' + friend2 + ' with ' + this.pet
 *   }
 *   
 *   // We are returning the dict we called "Public" to the outside world;
 *   // All the private stuff will stay in this closure!
 *   return Public
 * }()) // Note that the ad-hoc function is being called here!
 * </pre>
